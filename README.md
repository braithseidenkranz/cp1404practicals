# CP1404 Practicals

This repository contains my weekly practical work for the subject **CP1404 – Programming II** at **James Cook University
**.
It includes exercises and programs demonstrating key programming concepts such as **functions, file I/O, lists, classes,
** and **clean code principles**.

## Lessons Learned about Clean Code

- Use **meaningful names** for variables, functions, and constants to make code easy to read.
- Ensure all functions follow the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - each function should do one thing only.
- Remove unnecessary repetition by using **loops, functions, or constants**.
- Add **docstrings and comments** to explain what your code does and why.
