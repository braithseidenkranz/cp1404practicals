# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually my estimate would be about 10 mins away from the actual time it took apart from larger tasks that I
underestimated.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimates did improve slightly as the more tasks I did the better I was at knowing how long it would take.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I often overestimates how long a task would take me.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learnt that there is always room for improvement, even if it's a minor change.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learnt that there are many ways of approaching the same task.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review 1](https://github.com/Kate-Archer/cp1404practicals/pull/3#issuecomment-3544725582)

### Explanation

Kate wanted tips on comments, docstrings, formatting and coding patterns. I pointed out two spots where she should
create a variable instead of having a 'Magic number' and helped improve 2 docstrings.

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review 2](https://github.com/Keya7479/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

In this code review I suggested change some variable names to be better suited to the context, suggested using '.get' to
simplify a piece of code and '.lower' to make the user input case-insensitive.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Not sure

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Code structure and variable names
